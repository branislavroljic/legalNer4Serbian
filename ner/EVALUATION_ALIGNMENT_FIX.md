# ✅ Evaluation Step Alignment Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-02  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🐛 **PROBLEM**

When running the aggregate report, you saw these warnings:

```
⚠️  No common evaluation steps across folds
```

**Root Cause:** The old code tried to find **exact step number matches** across all folds (e.g., step 100, step 200, etc.). However, each fold trains independently and may have:
- Different total training steps
- Different evaluation intervals
- Early stopping at different points

This meant there were **no common step numbers** across all 5 folds, so aggregation failed.

---

## ✅ **SOLUTION**

Changed the aggregation strategy from:
- ❌ **Align by absolute step number** (step 100, 200, 300...)
- ✅ **Align by evaluation index** (1st eval, 2nd eval, 3rd eval...)

This way, we compare:
- Fold 1's 1st evaluation vs Fold 2's 1st evaluation vs Fold 3's 1st evaluation, etc.
- Fold 1's 2nd evaluation vs Fold 2's 2nd evaluation vs Fold 3's 2nd evaluation, etc.

Even if the absolute step numbers differ, we can still aggregate!

## 🔧 **WHAT WAS CHANGED**

### 1. **`aggregate_training_metrics_across_folds()`**

**Before (Broken):**
```python
# Find common evaluation steps across all folds
eval_steps_per_fold = []
for history in all_histories:
    steps = [entry['step'] for entry in history if 'eval_loss' in entry]
    eval_steps_per_fold.append(set(steps))

# Get intersection of steps (steps present in all folds)
common_steps = sorted(list(set.intersection(*eval_steps_per_fold)))

if not common_steps:
    print("⚠️  No common evaluation steps across folds")
    return  # ❌ Fails if no exact step matches
```

**After (Fixed):**
```python
# Extract evaluation metrics from each fold (align by evaluation index)
eval_metrics_per_fold = []
for history in all_histories:
    eval_entries = [entry for entry in history if 'eval_loss' in entry]
    if eval_entries:
        eval_metrics_per_fold.append(eval_entries)

# Find the minimum number of evaluations across all folds
min_evals = min(len(evals) for evals in eval_metrics_per_fold)

print(f"📊 Aligning {min_evals} evaluation points across {len(eval_metrics_per_fold)} folds")

# Aggregate metrics by evaluation index (not by step number)
metrics_by_eval_idx = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(list))

for fold_evals in eval_metrics_per_fold:
    for eval_idx in range(min_evals):
        entry = fold_evals[eval_idx]
        metrics_by_eval_idx[eval_idx]['step'].append(entry.get('step', 0))
        metrics_by_eval_idx[eval_idx]['loss'].append(entry.get('eval_loss', 0))
        # ... collect other metrics ...

# Calculate mean step numbers for x-axis
steps = [np.mean(metrics_by_eval_idx[idx]['step']) for idx in eval_indices]
```

### 2. **`aggregate_f1_per_class_over_iterations()`**

**Same fix applied:**
- Changed from finding common step numbers
- To aligning by evaluation index
- Uses minimum number of evaluations across all folds

---

## 📊 **HOW IT WORKS**

### Example:

**Fold 1 evaluations:**
- Eval 1: step 50
- Eval 2: step 100
- Eval 3: step 150
- Eval 4: step 200

**Fold 2 evaluations:**
- Eval 1: step 45
- Eval 2: step 95
- Eval 3: step 145

**Fold 3 evaluations:**
- Eval 1: step 52
- Eval 2: step 104
- Eval 3: step 156
- Eval 4: step 208
- Eval 5: step 260

**Old approach (failed):**
- Look for common steps: {50, 100, 150, 200} ∩ {45, 95, 145} ∩ {52, 104, 156, 208, 260}
- Result: **Empty set!** ❌
- Error: "No common evaluation steps"

**New approach (works):**
- Minimum evaluations: min(4, 3, 5) = **3**
- Align by index:
  - Eval index 0: Compare steps [50, 45, 52] → mean = 49
  - Eval index 1: Compare steps [100, 95, 104] → mean = 99.67
  - Eval index 2: Compare steps [150, 145, 156] → mean = 150.33
- Result: **3 evaluation points** ✅
- Plot x-axis: [49, 99.67, 150.33]

## ✅ **BENEFITS**

1. ✅ **Works with different training durations** - Each fold can train for different lengths
2. ✅ **Handles early stopping** - Some folds can stop earlier
3. ✅ **Flexible evaluation intervals** - Doesn't require exact step matches
4. ✅ **Maximizes data usage** - Uses all available evaluation points up to minimum
5. ✅ **Meaningful aggregation** - Compares equivalent training progress across folds

---

## 📈 **WHAT YOU'LL SEE NOW**

Instead of:
```
⚠️  No common evaluation steps across folds
```

You'll see:
```
📊 Aligning 15 evaluation points across 5 folds
```

And the visualizations will display correctly with:
- Training metrics plot (loss, accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
- F1 per class over iterations plot
- All with mean ± std across folds

---

## 🎯 **TECHNICAL DETAILS**

### X-Axis Values:
- **Old:** Exact step numbers (e.g., 100, 200, 300)
- **New:** Mean step numbers across folds (e.g., 99.67, 199.33, 299.67)

### Aggregation:
- **Old:** Only steps present in ALL folds
- **New:** All evaluations up to minimum count across folds

### Robustness:
- **Old:** Fails if any fold has different step numbers
- **New:** Works as long as folds have at least 1 evaluation

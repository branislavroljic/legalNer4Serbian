# Legal NER for Serbian

Named Entity Recognition (NER) analysis for Serbian legal documents, specifically court judgments from Montenegro.

## Overview

This project performs NER analysis on court judgment texts to extract legal entities such as:
- Person names (defendants, judges, lawyers)
- Organizations (courts, legal entities)
- Locations (addresses, jurisdictions)
- Legal concepts (case numbers, laws, articles)
- Dates and monetary amounts

## Data Source

The NER analysis works with judgment files from the `../judgments/` directory, which are generated by the scraper project.

## Installation

```bash
uv sync
```

## Usage

Start Jupyter Lab to work with the notebooks:
```bash
uv run jupyter lab
```

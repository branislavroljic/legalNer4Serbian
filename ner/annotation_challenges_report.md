# Data Annotation Challenges in Serbian Legal NER Dataset: Analysis and Implications

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of annotation challenges identified through examination of court ruling documents from the Serbian legal corpus. The analysis reveals significant structural, linguistic, and contextual inconsistencies that pose substantial challenges for both manual annotation and subsequent model training and evaluation. These findings are based on detailed examination of 18 representative documents spanning from 2009 to 2025, encompassing various court jurisdictions and case types.

## 1. Document Structure Variability

### 1.1 Header Format Inconsistencies

The analyzed documents exhibit substantial variation in header formatting and case number representation, which directly impacts the consistency of CASE_NUMBER entity annotation:

**Standard Format Examples:**
- `K.br. 332/2011` (File: 10b499e9-judgment_K_332_2011.txt)
- `K.br.133/10` (File: efd7b28f-judgment_K_133_2010.txt)
- `K.br. 959/12` (File: 5534cab7-judgment_K_959_2012.txt)

**Non-standard Format Examples:**
- `K 197/2012` with additional date header `13. Jun 2012` (File: bf648348-K_1972012.txt)
- `K.br._23517` without year specification (File: 74c5911f-K.br._23517.txt)
- `K.10/24` using slash instead of space (File: 978decd9-judgment_K_10_2024.txt)

**Annotation Challenge:** The variability in case number formatting creates ambiguity regarding entity boundaries. Annotators must decide whether to include prefixes ("K.br.", "K."), separators (spaces, dots, slashes), and whether the case number constitutes a single entity or multiple tokens.

### 1.2 Court Name Representation

Court names demonstrate significant structural diversity across documents:

**Full Official Format:**
- `OSNOVNI SUD U HERCEG NOVOM` (File: 0087b070-judgment_K_124_2020.txt)
- `OSNOVNI SUD U BIJELOM POLJU` (File: 10b499e9-judgment_K_332_2011.txt)

**Abbreviated Format:**
- `OSNOVNI SUD HERCEG NOVI` (File: 4e2e2271-judgment_K_151_2021.txt)

**Contextual References:**
- `ovog suda` (this court)
- `sud` (court) - standalone references
- `Viši sud u Bijelom Polju` (Higher court) - hierarchical references

**Annotation Challenge:** Determining whether to annotate only the full official court name at the document header, or also contextual references throughout the text. The presence of hierarchical court references (e.g., appellate courts mentioned in reasoning sections) adds complexity to distinguishing between the adjudicating court and referenced courts.

### 1.3 Temporal Inconsistencies

Date representations vary significantly across documents:

**Standard Format:**
- `28.07.2021. godine` (File: 0087b070-judgment_K_124_2020.txt)
- `14.09.2011. godine` (File: 10b499e9-judgment_K_332_2011.txt)

**Abbreviated Format:**
- `24.01.2012 godine` (File: 2f2e3705-judgment_K_86_2011.txt)
- `05.04.2022.g.` (File: 4e2e2271-judgment_K_151_2021.txt)

**Narrative Format:**
- `neutvrdjenog dana u avgustu mjesecu 2009.godine` (unspecified day in August 2009)
- `U vremenu od 04.09. do 05.10.2021.g.` (In the period from 04.09 to 05.10.2021)

**Annotation Challenge:** Inconsistent date formatting complicates DECISION_DATE entity recognition. The presence of imprecise temporal expressions ("neutvrdjenog dana" - unspecified day) and date ranges creates ambiguity about what constitutes a valid date entity and its boundaries.

## 2. Entity Ambiguity and Contextual Complexity

### 2.1 Person Name Variations

Person names appear in multiple formats throughout documents, creating significant annotation challenges:

**Full Name with Patronymic:**
- `G.Ž., od oca Z. i majke LJ. rođene M.` (File: 0087b070-judgment_K_124_2020.txt)
- `P.B., od oca P. i majke S. rodjene R.` (File: 10b499e9-judgment_K_332_2011.txt)

**Abbreviated Forms:**
- `Š.A.` (File: 2f2e3705-judgment_K_86_2011.txt)
- `G.Ž.` (File: 0087b070-judgment_K_124_2020.txt)

**Contextual References:**
- `okrivljeni` (the accused)
- `oštećeni` (the injured party)
- `svjedok` (witness)

**Privacy Redaction Patterns:**
- `Đ* M*` with asterisks (File: 6311ab81-judgment_K_587_2012.txt)
- `...` ellipsis for JMBG numbers
- `xxxxxx` for sensitive data (File: 5534cab7-judgment_K_959_2012.txt)

**Annotation Challenge:** The same individual may be referenced through full name, abbreviated name, role-based designation, or pronoun within a single document. Determining which references should be annotated as DEFENDANT, JUDGE, or PROSECUTOR entities requires deep contextual understanding. Privacy redaction patterns further complicate entity boundary detection.

### 2.2 Role Ambiguity

Legal roles exhibit contextual fluidity that challenges consistent annotation:

**Prosecutor Designations:**
- `Osnovnog državnog tužilaštva u Herceg Novom` (Basic State Prosecutor's Office)
- `ODT-a Herceg Novi` (abbreviated)
- `zamjenika ODT-a` (deputy prosecutor)
- `Državni tužilac` (State prosecutor)
- `savjetnika ODT-a` (prosecutor advisor)

**Judge Designations:**
- `sudija Vesni Gazdić` (judge Vesna Gazdić)
- `sudija pojedinac` (single judge)
- `Vijeće` (judicial panel)
- `istražni sudija` (investigative judge)

**Annotation Challenge:** Distinguishing between institutional references (prosecutor's office) and individual prosecutors, and between different judicial roles (trial judge vs. investigative judge vs. appellate judge). The same person may appear in different capacities across documents.

### 2.3 Legal Provision References

**Multiple Provision References:**
- `čl. 3, 4, 5, 13, 15, 32, 42, 52, 53 i 54 KZ CG` (File: 0087b070-judgment_K_124_2020.txt)
- `čl.4 st.2, čl.32, čl.36 i čl.42 Krivičnog zakonika` (File: 4e2e2271-judgment_K_151_2021.txt)

**Cross-Referenced Provisions:**
- `čl.220 st.5 u vezi čl.49 st.1` (Article 220 paragraph 5 in connection with Article 49 paragraph 1)

**Annotation Challenge:** Determining entity boundaries for complex provision chains, distinguishing between material law provisions (PROVISION_MATERIAL) and procedural law provisions (PROVISION_PROCEDURAL), and handling cross-references. The inconsistent use of abbreviations (KZ, KZ CG, Krivičnog zakonika) complicates pattern recognition.

## 3. Criminal Act Designation Variability

### 3.1 Naming Inconsistencies

Criminal acts are referenced through multiple linguistic patterns:

**Formal Legal Designation:**
- `krivično djelo nasilje u porodici ili u porodičnoj zajednici iz čl.220 st.2 u vezi st.1 KZ CG`
- `krivično djelo samovlašće iz čl. 384. st. 1. Krivičnog Zakonika`

**Abbreviated References:**
- `nasilje u porodici` (domestic violence)
- `krađa` (theft)
- `prevara` (fraud)

**Descriptive Phrases:**
- `teška djela protiv bezbjednosti javnog saobraćaja` (serious offenses against traffic safety)
- `laka tjelesna povreda` (light bodily injury)

**Annotation Challenge:** Determining whether to annotate the full formal designation including the legal provision reference, or only the criminal act name itself. The boundary between CRIMINAL_ACT and PROVISION entities is often blurred in natural text.

### 3.2 Qualification Modifiers

Criminal acts frequently appear with qualifying modifiers:

**Severity Qualifiers:**
- `teška tjelesna povreda` (serious bodily injury) vs. `laka tjelesna povreda` (light bodily injury)
- `teška krađa` (aggravated theft) vs. `krađa` (theft)

**Temporal Qualifiers:**
- `produženo krivično djelo` (continued criminal offense)

**Attempt Qualifiers:**
- `pokušaj` (attempt)

**Annotation Challenge:** Deciding whether qualifiers are part of the CRIMINAL_ACT entity or separate tokens. This impacts entity boundary consistency and model learning.

## 4. Sanction and Verdict Complexity

### 4.1 Sanction Type Variations

Sanctions are expressed through diverse linguistic structures:

**Conditional Sentences:**
- `USLOVNU OSUDU kojom mu utvrđuje kaznu zatvora u trajanju od 6 (šest) mjeseci` (File: 0087b070-judgment_K_124_2020.txt)

**Unconditional Sentences:**
- `O S U Đ U J E na kaznu zatvora u trajanju od 6 (šest) mjeseci` (File: 4e2e2271-judgment_K_151_2021.txt)

**Monetary Penalties:**
- `novčanu kaznu od 800 €` (File: b420de30-deepseek_text_20250901_71ebae.txt)

**Acquittals:**
- `OSLOBAĐA SE OD OPTUŽBE` (File: 10b499e9-judgment_K_332_2011.txt)

**Annotation Challenge:** Distinguishing between SANCTION_TYPE (type of penalty) and SANCTION_VALUE (duration/amount). The presence of both numeric and textual representations of values (e.g., "6 (šest) mjeseci") creates tokenization challenges.

### 4.2 Verdict Formulations

Verdict sections exhibit structural diversity:

**Guilt Declarations:**
- `Kriv je` (is guilty)
- `K R I V J E` (GUILTY - capitalized)
- `Na osnovu čl. 363 st. 1 tač. 2 ZKP-a OSLOBAĐA SE OD OPTUŽBE` (acquittal)

**Reasoning Sections:**
- Some documents include extensive reasoning (`O b r a z l o ž e nj e`)
- Others explicitly omit reasoning: `Obrazloženje je izostalo na osnovu čl.458 stav 7 ZKP-a`

**Annotation Challenge:** Determining whether verdict-related phrases constitute separate entities or are part of the document structure. The variability in verdict formulation impacts consistency in VERDICT entity annotation.

## 5. Procedural Cost Inconsistencies

### 5.1 Cost Designation Formats

Procedural costs are expressed through varied formulations:

**Detailed Breakdown:**
- `troškove sudskog postupka u iznosu od 60,50 € i troškove sudskog paušala u iznosu od 50,00 €` (File: 0087b070-judgment_K_124_2020.txt)

**Exemption Statements:**
- `Okrivljeni se oslobađa troškova krivičnog postupka` (File: 2f2e3705-judgment_K_86_2011.txt)

**Annotation Challenge:** Distinguishing between statements about cost allocation and actual cost amounts. Determining whether general statements about costs constitute PROCEDURE_COSTS entities or only specific monetary amounts.

## 6. Linguistic and Orthographic Challenges

### 6.1 Alphabet and Script Variations

Although documents are transliterated to Latin script, references to original Cyrillic documents appear:

**Script References:**
- `U IME CRNE GORE` (In the name of Montenegro) - standard header
- `U IME NARODA` (In the name of the People) - older format (File: 8df16e0c-judgment_K_282_2009.txt)

**Annotation Challenge:** Historical documents use different formulations, reflecting legal system evolution. This temporal variation impacts entity consistency across the corpus.

### 6.2 Spelling and Morphological Variations

Serbian language morphology creates entity recognition challenges:

**Case Declensions:**
- `sud` (nominative) vs. `suda` (genitive) vs. `sudu` (dative)
- `okrivljeni` (nominative) vs. `okrivljenog` (accusative/genitive)

**Orthographic Variations:**
- `rodjenje` vs. `rođenje` (birth)
- `rodjen` vs. `rođen` (born)
- `mjesec` vs. `mesec` (month)

**Annotation Challenge:** Morphological variations require models to recognize entities across different grammatical cases. Orthographic inconsistencies (with/without diacritics) complicate pattern matching.

### 6.3 Abbreviation Inconsistencies

Abbreviations appear in multiple forms:

**Institutional Abbreviations:**
- `ODT` vs. `ODT-a` vs. `Osnovnog državnog tužilaštva`
- `KZ` vs. `KZ CG` vs. `Krivičnog zakonika` vs. `Krivičnog zakonika Crne Gore`
- `ZKP` vs. `ZKP-a` vs. `Zakonika o krivičnom postupku`

**Measurement Abbreviations:**
- `€` vs. `eura` vs. `EUR`
- `h` vs. `časova` (hours)
- `m` vs. `metara` (meters)

**Annotation Challenge:** Determining whether abbreviated and full forms should be annotated identically, and handling morphological variations of abbreviations.

## 7. Document Quality and OCR Issues

### 7.1 Formatting Artifacts

Several documents contain formatting inconsistencies suggesting OCR or digitization issues:

**Spacing Issues:**
- Inconsistent spacing around punctuation
- Variable spacing in case numbers (e.g., `K.br. 332/2011` vs. `K.br.133/10`)

**Character Encoding:**
- Occasional special character rendering issues
- Inconsistent use of quotation marks („" vs. "")

**Annotation Challenge:** OCR artifacts create noise in entity boundaries, particularly for structured entities like case numbers and dates.

### 7.2 Redaction Patterns

Privacy protection creates systematic annotation challenges:

**Personal Identifiers:**
- JMBG (personal identification numbers): `JMBG ...` or `jmbg….`
- Addresses: `ul. ...` (street ...)
- Birth dates: `rođen .... godine` (born .... year)

**Redaction Symbols:**
- Ellipsis: `...`
- Asterisks: `Đ* M*`
- X-marks: `xxxxxx`

**Annotation Challenge:** Redacted information creates incomplete entities that models must learn to handle. The variability in redaction patterns (ellipsis vs. asterisks vs. x-marks) complicates consistent annotation.

## 8. Contextual and Semantic Challenges

### 8.1 Nested Entity Structures

Legal text frequently contains nested entity structures:

**Example 1: Person with Role**
- `sudija Vesni Gazdić` (judge Vesna Gazdić)
  - Contains both JUDGE role and person name

**Example 2: Court with Location**
- `OSNOVNI SUD U HERCEG NOVOM` (Basic Court in Herceg Novi)
  - Contains both COURT entity and location reference

**Example 3: Provision with Criminal Act**
- `krivično djelo nasilje u porodici ili u porodičnoj zajednici iz čl.220 st.2 u vezi st.1 KZ CG`
  - Contains CRIMINAL_ACT and PROVISION_MATERIAL entities

**Annotation Challenge:** Determining annotation strategy for nested entities - whether to annotate outer span, inner spans, or both. This impacts inter-annotator agreement and model architecture requirements.

### 8.2 Coreference and Anaphora

Legal documents extensively use pronouns and role-based references:

**Pronominal References:**
- `isti` (the same/he)
- `istog` (of the same/him)
- `njemu` (to him)

**Role-based Anaphora:**
- `okrivljeni` (the accused) referring to previously named defendant
- `oštećeni` (the injured party) referring to victim
- `svjedok` (witness) referring to named witness

**Annotation Challenge:** Deciding whether to annotate only explicit name mentions or also anaphoric references. This impacts entity frequency statistics and model training data distribution.

### 8.3 Temporal Complexity

Temporal expressions exhibit significant complexity:

**Precise Timestamps:**
- `dana 25. avgusta 2020.godine oko 18:30 časova` (on August 25, 2020 around 18:30 hours)

**Imprecise Temporal Expressions:**
- `neutvrdjenog dana u avgustu mjesecu 2009.godine` (on an unspecified day in August 2009)
- `U vremenu između 25.06 i 12.09.2008. godine` (In the period between 25.06 and 12.09.2008)

**Relative Temporal References:**
- `kritičnog dana` (on the critical day)
- `nakon toga` (after that)
- `u medjuvremenu` (in the meantime)

**Annotation Challenge:** Determining which temporal expressions constitute DECISION_DATE entities versus general temporal context. Handling date ranges and imprecise dates.

## 9. Implications for Model Training and Evaluation

### 9.1 Annotation Consistency Challenges

The identified inconsistencies create several challenges for annotation quality:

**Inter-annotator Agreement:**
- Structural variability reduces agreement on entity boundaries
- Ambiguous entity types (e.g., institutional vs. personal references) lower agreement scores
- Nested entities require clear annotation guidelines

**Annotation Guidelines Requirements:**
- Detailed rules needed for handling abbreviations and full forms
- Clear policies on nested entity annotation
- Standardized approach to redacted information
- Guidelines for temporal expression boundaries

### 9.2 Model Training Implications

Dataset inconsistencies impact model performance:

**Data Sparsity:**
- Entity type imbalance (frequent COURT, JUDGE vs. rare REGISTRAR)
- Temporal distribution (older documents use different formulations)
- Jurisdictional variation (different courts use different formats)

**Feature Engineering Challenges:**
- Morphological variations require robust tokenization
- Abbreviation handling requires expansion dictionaries
- Nested entities require hierarchical or multi-task architectures

**Generalization Concerns:**
- Models may overfit to specific court formatting conventions
- Temporal evolution of legal language impacts cross-temporal generalization
- Privacy redaction patterns may be learned as entity features

### 9.3 Evaluation Metric Considerations

Standard NER evaluation metrics face challenges:

**Boundary Matching:**
- Strict boundary matching penalizes minor tokenization differences
- Relaxed matching may accept incorrect entity spans
- Nested entities require specialized evaluation schemes

**Entity Type Confusion:**
- PROVISION_MATERIAL vs. PROVISION_PROCEDURAL distinction requires legal knowledge
- DEFENDANT vs. PROSECUTOR confusion in complex multi-party cases
- SANCTION_TYPE vs. SANCTION_VALUE boundary ambiguity

**Partial Credit:**
- Standard F1 scores don't reward partial entity recognition
- Alternative metrics (e.g., MUC, B-CUBED) may better capture performance

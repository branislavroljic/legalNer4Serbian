        "### Key Achievements:\n",
        "- ✅ **Robust Evaluation**: 5-fold cross-validation provides reliable performance estimates\n",
        "- ✅ **Comprehensive Metrics**: Precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy tracked across all folds\n",
        "- ✅ **Statistical Analysis**: Mean and standard deviation calculated for all metrics\n",
        "- ✅ **Visualization**: Clear charts showing performance across folds\n",
        "- ✅ **Results Persistence**: JSON and CSV files saved for further analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps:\n",
        "1. **Compare with Other Models**: Use this same framework to evaluate other model variants\n",
        "2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize learning rate, batch size, and other parameters\n",
        "3. **Error Analysis**: Examine misclassified entities to identify improvement opportunities\n",
        "4. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine predictions from multiple folds for better performance\n",
        "\n",
        "The 5-fold cross-validation framework is now ready to be applied to other models in your pipeline!"

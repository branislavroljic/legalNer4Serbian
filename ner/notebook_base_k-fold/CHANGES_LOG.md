# Changes Log - 5-Fold CV Notebooks Completion

**Date:** 2025-10-02  
**Action:** Fixed incomplete notebooks by adding missing code sections

---

## File 1: `serbian_legal_ner_pipeline_xlm_r_bertic_5fold_cv.ipynb`

### Before:
- **Lines:** 599
- **Status:** Incomplete - ended after training loop
- **Missing:** Results aggregation, visualization, export, conclusion

### After:
- **Lines:** 830
- **Status:** Complete
- **Added:** 231 lines

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Added Section 9: Aggregate Results Across Folds (Lines 583-609)
```python
# Extract metrics from all folds
precisions = [result['precision'] for result in fold_results]
recalls = [result['recall'] for result in fold_results]
f1_scores = [result['f1'] for result in fold_results]
accuracies = [result['accuracy'] for result in fold_results]

# Calculate statistics
print(f"Precision: {np.mean(precisions):.4f} ± {np.std(precisions):.4f}")
print(f"Recall:    {np.mean(recalls):.4f} ± {np.std(recalls):.4f}")
print(f"F1-Score:  {np.mean(f1_scores):.4f} ± {np.std(f1_scores):.4f}")
print(f"Accuracy:  {np.mean(accuracies):.4f} ± {np.std(accuracies):.4f}")
```

#### 2. Added Section 10: Visualization (Lines 611-683)
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create 2x2 subplot visualization
fig, ((ax1, ax2), (ax3, ax4)) = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(15, 10))
fig.suptitle(f'{N_FOLDS}-Fold Cross-Validation Results - XLM-R-BERTić Model')

# Plot precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy across folds
# Save as PNG file
plt.savefig(f"{OUTPUT_DIR}/xlm_r_bertic_5fold_cv_results.png", dpi=300)
```

#### 3. Added Section 11: Save Results (Lines 685-767)
```python
import json
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

# Create results summary
results_summary = {
    'experiment_info': {...},
    'overall_metrics': {...},
    'fold_results': [...]
}

# Save to JSON
with open(results_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    json.dump(results_summary, f, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)

# Save to CSV
df_results.to_csv(csv_file, index=False)
```

#### 4. Added Section 12: Conclusion (Lines 769-830)
- Comprehensive markdown cell with:
  - Key achievements
  - XLM-R-BERTić advantages
  - Next steps

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Added Section 11: Training Loop (Lines 610-693)
```python
# Main K-Fold Cross-Validation Loop for Class Weights
for fold_num, (train_idx, val_idx) in enumerate(kfold.split(examples_array), 1):
    # Prepare data with class weights
    train_dataset, val_dataset, data_collator, class_weights = prepare_fold_data_with_weights(
        train_examples, val_examples, tokenizer, ner_dataset
    )
    
    # Create model and weighted trainer
    model, trainer, fold_output_dir = create_class_weights_model_and_trainer(
        fold_num, train_dataset, val_dataset, data_collator, 
        tokenizer, ner_dataset, class_weights, device
    )
    
    # Train and evaluate
    trainer.train()
    trainer.save_model()
    eval_results = detailed_evaluation(trainer, val_dataset, ...)
    
    # Store results
    fold_results.append(fold_result)
    
    # Cleanup
    del model, trainer, train_dataset, val_dataset
    torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

#### 2. Added Section 12: Aggregate Results (Lines 695-721)
```python
# Extract metrics from all folds
precisions = [result['precision'] for result in fold_results]
recalls = [result['recall'] for result in fold_results]
f1_scores = [result['f1'] for result in fold_results]
accuracies = [result['accuracy'] for result in fold_results]

# Calculate statistics
print(f"Precision: {np.mean(precisions):.4f} ± {np.std(precisions):.4f}")
print(f"Recall:    {np.mean(recalls):.4f} ± {np.std(recalls):.4f}")
print(f"F1-Score:  {np.mean(f1_scores):.4f} ± {np.std(f1_scores):.4f}")
print(f"Accuracy:  {np.mean(accuracies):.4f} ± {np.std(accuracies):.4f}")
```

#### 3. Added Section 13: Visualization (Lines 723-795)
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create 2x2 subplot visualization
fig, ((ax1, ax2), (ax3, ax4)) = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(15, 10))
fig.suptitle(f'{N_FOLDS}-Fold Cross-Validation Results - Class Weights Model')

# Plot precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy across folds
# Save as PNG file
plt.savefig(f"{OUTPUT_DIR}/class_weights_5fold_cv_results.png", dpi=300)
```

#### 4. Added Section 14: Save Results (Lines 797-879)
```python
import json
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

# Create results summary
results_summary = {
    'experiment_info': {...},
    'overall_metrics': {...},
    'fold_results': [...]
}

# Save to JSON
with open(results_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    json.dump(results_summary, f, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)

# Save to CSV
df_results.to_csv(csv_file, index=False)
```

#### 5. Added Section 15: Conclusion (Lines 881-958)
- Comprehensive markdown cell with:
  - Key achievements
  - Class weights advantages
  - Next steps

## Summary of Additions

### XLM-R-BERTić Notebook:
- ✅ Results aggregation code (27 lines)
- ✅ Visualization code (73 lines)
- ✅ Results export code (83 lines)
- ✅ Conclusion documentation (48 lines)
- **Total:** 231 lines added

### Class Weights Notebook:
- ✅ Training loop execution (84 lines)
- ✅ Results aggregation code (27 lines)
- ✅ Visualization code (73 lines)
- ✅ Results export code (83 lines)
- ✅ Conclusion documentation (65 lines)
- **Total:** 332 lines added

---

## Imports Added

### Both Notebooks:
```python
import json                    # For JSON export
import pandas as pd           # For CSV export and DataFrame
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # For visualization
from datetime import datetime  # For timestamps
```

These imports were added in the appropriate sections (visualization and results saving) rather than at the top of the notebook, following the pattern established in the Base BERT notebook.

---

## Files Created by Notebooks

After running the completed notebooks, the following files will be created:

### XLM-R-BERTić:
- `{OUTPUT_DIR}/xlm_r_bertic_5fold_cv_results.png` - Visualization
- `{OUTPUT_DIR}/5fold_cv_results.json` - JSON results
- `{OUTPUT_DIR}/5fold_cv_results.csv` - CSV results
- `{OUTPUT_DIR}/fold_{1-5}/` - Model checkpoints for each fold

### Class Weights:
- `{OUTPUT_DIR}/class_weights_5fold_cv_results.png` - Visualization
- `{OUTPUT_DIR}/5fold_cv_results.json` - JSON results
- `{OUTPUT_DIR}/5fold_cv_results.csv` - CSV results
- `{OUTPUT_DIR}/fold_{1-5}/` - Model checkpoints for each fold

---

## Verification Steps

To verify the changes:

1. **Check file sizes:**
   ```bash
   wc -l ner/notebook_base_k-fold/serbian_legal_ner_pipeline_xlm_r_bertic_5fold_cv.ipynb
   # Should show 830 lines
   
   wc -l ner/notebook_base_k-fold/serbian_legal_ner_pipeline_class_weights_5fold_cv.ipynb
   # Should show 958 lines
   ```

2. **Open in Jupyter/Colab:**
   - Verify all sections are present
   - Check that markdown cells render correctly
   - Ensure code cells have proper syntax

3. **Run the notebooks:**
   - Execute all cells sequentially
   - Verify no import errors
   - Check that results files are created
   - Confirm visualizations are generated

---

## Notes

- All changes maintain consistency with the Base BERT and BERT-CRF notebooks
- Code follows the same structure and style as existing notebooks
- All new code uses shared module functions where appropriate
- Visualization style matches other notebooks (same colors, layout, etc.)
- Results export format is identical across all notebooks for easy comparison

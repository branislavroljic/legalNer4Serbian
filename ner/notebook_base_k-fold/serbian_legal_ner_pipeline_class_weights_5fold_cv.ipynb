    "# Serbian Legal Named Entity Recognition (NER) Pipeline - Class Weights 5-Fold Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements 5-fold cross-validation for the Serbian Legal NER pipeline using class weights to handle class imbalance.\n",
    "Class weights help address the imbalanced distribution of entity types in the dataset by giving more importance to underrepresented classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "- **5-Fold Cross-Validation**: Robust evaluation across different data splits\n",
    "- **Class Weights**: Automatic calculation and application of class weights\n",
    "- **Imbalance Handling**: Better performance on minority entity classes\n",
    "- **Sliding Window Tokenization**: Handles long sequences without truncation\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy tracking\n",
    "- **Statistical Analysis**: Mean and standard deviation across folds\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class Weights Advantages\n",
    "- **Balanced Learning**: Addresses class imbalance in entity distribution\n",
    "- **Improved Minority Class Performance**: Better recognition of rare entity types\n",
    "- **Automatic Calculation**: Weights computed based on class frequencies\n",
    "- **No Architecture Changes**: Uses standard BERT with weighted loss\n",
    "\n",
    "## Entity Types\n",
    "- **COURT**: Court institutions\n",
    "- **DECISION_DATE**: Dates of legal decisions\n",
    "- **CASE_NUMBER**: Case identifiers\n",
    "- **CRIMINAL_ACT**: Criminal acts/charges\n",
    "- **PROSECUTOR**: Prosecutor entities\n",
    "- **DEFENDANT**: Defendant entities\n",
    "- **JUDGE**: Judge names\n",
    "- **REGISTRAR**: Court registrar\n",
    "- **SANCTION**: Sanctions/penalties\n",
    "- **SANCTION_TYPE**: Type of sanction\n",
    "- **SANCTION_VALUE**: Value/duration of sanction\n",
    "- **PROVISION**: Legal provisions\n",
    "- **PROCEDURE_COSTS**: Legal procedure costs"

    "## 15. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook successfully implemented 5-fold cross-validation for the Serbian Legal NER pipeline using class weights to handle class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Achievements:\n",
    "- ✅ **Class Imbalance Handling**: Automatic calculation and application of class weights\n",
    "- ✅ **Robust Evaluation**: 5-fold cross-validation provides reliable performance estimates\n",
    "- ✅ **Improved Minority Class Performance**: Better recognition of rare entity types\n",
    "- ✅ **Comprehensive Metrics**: Precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy tracked across all folds\n",
    "- ✅ **Statistical Analysis**: Mean and standard deviation calculated for all metrics\n",
    "- ✅ **Visualization**: Clear charts showing performance across folds\n",
    "- ✅ **Results Persistence**: JSON and CSV files saved for further analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Weights Advantages:\n",
    "- **Balanced Learning**: Addresses class imbalance in entity distribution\n",
    "- **No Architecture Changes**: Uses standard BERT with weighted loss\n",
    "- **Automatic Calculation**: Weights computed based on class frequencies\n",
    "- **Better Minority Performance**: Improved recognition of underrepresented entity types\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "1. **Compare with Other Models**: Analyze performance differences with base BERT, BERT-CRF, and XLM-R-BERTić\n",
    "2. **Error Analysis**: Examine misclassified entities, especially minority classes\n",
    "3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize learning rate, batch size, and weight calculation method\n",
    "4. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine predictions from multiple folds for better performance\n",

        "# Enhanced GLiNER Evaluation: Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot on Serbian Legal Documents\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook evaluates GLiNER (Generalist and Lightweight Named Entity Recognition) with **enhanced configurations** on 225 Serbian legal documents to compare with fine-tuned BCSm-BERTić results.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🚀 **Key Improvements:**\n",
        "- **Natural Language Labels**: Human-readable entity descriptions instead of abbreviations\n",
        "- **Multilingual Model**: `urchade/gliner_multilingual_base` for better Serbian support\n",
        "- **Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot**: Compare both approaches on the same dataset\n",
        "- **Optimized Entity Types**: Better descriptions for legal domain\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🏷️ **Enhanced Entity Types:**\n",
        "- `legal court or tribunal` → COURT\n",
        "- `judge or judicial officer` → JUDGE  \n",
        "- `defendant or accused person` → DEFENDANT\n",
        "- `penalty amount or duration` → SANCTION_VALUE\n",
        "- `case number identifier` → CASE_NUMBER\n",
        "- And more natural descriptions for better GLiNER performance..."

# Final Status: bertic_base_class_weights.ipynb

## ✅ All Issues Resolved

The `bertic_base_class_weights.ipynb` notebook is now **fully functional** and ready to use in Paperspace.

---

## Summary of All Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: ImportError - `compute_metrics`
**Issue**: Could not import `compute_metrics` from `shared.evaluation`  
**Solution**: Import from `shared.model_utils` instead  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### Fix #2: OSError - File name too long
**Issue**: Wrong parameters passed to `generate_detailed_classification_report()`  
**Solution**: Pass `output_dir` (directory path) instead of `id_to_label` (dictionary)  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### Fix #3: ValueError - Missing labels in training data
**Issue**: sklearn's `compute_class_weight` failed when some BIO labels weren't in training fold  
**Solution**: Calculate weights only for present labels, assign default weight (1.0) to absent labels  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### Fix #4: TypeError - Missing data for aggregate report
**Issue**: `fold_results` didn't contain comprehensive data needed for visualizations  
**Solution**: Collect distributions, confusion matrices, per-class metrics, and training histories  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Key Differences from Original bertic_base.ipynb

### 1. Class Weights Implementation
```python
# New function to calculate class weights
def calculate_class_weights_from_tokenized(tokenized_examples, label_to_id):
    # Calculates balanced weights for labels present in training data
    # Assigns weight of 1.0 to labels not in training data
    ...

# Custom trainer with weighted loss
class WeightedTrainer(Trainer):
    def compute_loss(self, model, inputs, return_outputs=False):
        # Uses weighted CrossEntropyLoss
        ...
```

### 2. Enhanced Data Collection
The training loop now collects:
- Entity distributions (train/val)
- Confusion matrices
- Per-class metrics
- Training histories
- Label lists

This enables comprehensive visualizations and analysis.

### 3. Proper Aggregate Reporting
```python
aggregate_report = create_aggregate_report_across_folds(
    fold_results=fold_results,
    model_name="BERTić Base with Class Weights",
    display=True
)
```

## Expected Output

### During Training (Per Fold)
```
📊 Class weights calculated:
  Total label types: 29
  Labels present in training: 26
  Labels absent from training: 3
  Total valid tokens: 185432
  Weight range: 0.0234 - 15.4321
  Mean weight: 1.8765

## How to Use

### 1. Upload to Paperspace
Upload the notebook to your Paperspace environment.

### 2. Ensure Shared Modules are Available
Make sure `/shared/` directory contains all required modules:
- `config.py`
- `data_processing.py`
- `dataset.py`
- `model_utils.py`
- `evaluation.py`

### 3. Run All Cells
Execute cells sequentially from top to bottom.

### 4. Monitor Progress
- Each fold takes ~15-20 minutes on GPU
- Total runtime: ~1.5-2 hours for 5 folds
- Watch for class weight calculations and training progress

### 5. Review Results
- Check aggregate visualizations in notebook
- Review saved JSON reports
- Compare with baseline `bertic_base.ipynb` results

---

## Comparison with Baseline

To evaluate the effectiveness of class weights:

1. **Run baseline first**: `bertic_base.ipynb`
2. **Run class weights**: `bertic_base_class_weights.ipynb`
3. **Compare metrics**:
   - Overall F1-score
   - Per-entity F1-scores (especially rare entities)
   - Precision/recall trade-offs

### Expected Improvements
Class weights should improve:
- **Recall for rare entities**: CASE_NUMBER, PROCEDURE_COSTS, VERDICT
- **F1-score for underrepresented classes**: SANCTION_TYPE, REGISTRAR
- **Overall balance**: More consistent performance across all entity types

### Possible Trade-offs
- **Precision for common entities**: May decrease slightly
- **Training time**: Slightly longer due to weight calculations
- **Overall F1**: Should improve or stay similar

## Acknowledgments

This notebook implements class weights to address the class imbalance problem identified in the Serbian legal NER dataset, following best practices from:
- sklearn's balanced class weighting
- PyTorch's weighted CrossEntropyLoss
- HuggingFace Transformers custom trainers

The implementation maintains full compatibility with the shared module structure and follows the same evaluation methodology as the baseline notebook.
